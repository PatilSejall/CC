Start your Cloud Shell after installation of Gcloud SDK
After starting the shell you need your local dev app server file to run the application
So as you have opened the shell, you will have the dev app server file under the relative location of the shell i.e. google-cloud-sdk\bin\dev_appserver.py
Absolute Path : C:\Program Files (x86)\Google\Cloud SDK\google-cloud-sdk\bin\dev_appserver.py

Run the application with the following command in shell
cmd > py google-cloud-sdk\bin\dev_appserver.py <path to the directory where application resides>


py google-cloud-sdk\bin\dev_appserver.py address_of_folder_where_app.yml_is_saved

EXAMPLE :-   py google-cloud-sdk\bin\dev_appserver.py C:\Users\Desktop\Practicals\CC\Hello
